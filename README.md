# Chronstructor
## Introduction
The Chronstructor app is part of the teamproject module in the university.
In cooperation with communication designers and machine engineers from htwg constance we started to found a fictional startup called Chron.
At the end of the semester all startups compete about the investors.

The app Chronstructor is a augmented reality app which runs on the hololens device from microsoft.
The main idea is to build e.g. a engine with augmented reality to speedup the process. The app analyzes the parts of the engine which are needed in the current build step. So the benefit is saving time. Our main goal was language neutrality.

The development environment was unity3d, the buildtool universal studio and the main programing language was c#.

The analyzing process for detecting current engine parts was made by the vuforia framework.

## Additional Notes
Be aware that specifically the ui is written hardcoded. So when you want to use some other engines or building processes you will get ui inconsistencies.
